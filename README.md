Adds tree people into the game. I made this mod to add variety without cluttering up crafting or item menus. It does not add anything except for the race itself and a faction.

Tree people are:
+ Resilient to extreme temperatures
+ tough
+ immune to age related effects
- slow
- flammable

They also bleed sap and produce wood when butchered.

Requires Alien Race Framework 2.0
